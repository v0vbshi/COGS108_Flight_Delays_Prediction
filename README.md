This is your group repo for your final project for COGS108.

Today, we live in a society where airplanes are becoming one of the most essential transportation. However, as the increase in airplane usage, airplane delay has become a more serious problem that has caused many people inconveniences. For our project, we will focus on airliner delays, inspect some of the most influential causes that have led to flight delays and predict the potential aspects that people overlook. With our data analysis, we hope to give some insights to airlines that could potentially decrease airplane delays.
